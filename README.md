## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided. This is my third time starting this project. I'm having a hard time with figuring out how to position the background svg's. I also struggled with making everything responsive.

## My process

I started with the background first. Created a main section and gave it an id to position the background svg images. I had to look up how to apply two different background images because I forgot. Found the solution on MDN.
The Background images are positioned correctly when I have my browser window on one half of my screen at 681px. But when I resize the window bigger, the images move off screen and they move the opposite way when I make the window smaller. I'm not sure why that is but I think I have to fix it by using media queries?
Before I do that I'm going to give the background a 100vh and fix the overflow-x because this is a full page size design. Before I stop for the day I'm also going to fix the padding in the attribution div. As well as style the links and move it to the html and css to bottom.
I figured out why the bg imgs weren't showing in ph-pages. I had to fix the file to back out of two folders. I also figured out how to make the background images fixed, had to change the position value from % to px.
